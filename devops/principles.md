# DevOps

The principles of DevOps are:

### 1. maximize flow
(left-to-right) By taking a systems view and optimize for the outcomes. This is done using small batch sizes and intervals of work, making sure that defects are never passed downstream.

Requires:
 - continuous deployment
 - environments on demand
 - limiting work in process
 - building safe systems that are resilient to change

### 2. amplified feedback
(right-to-left) By providing constant feedback at every step, enabling faster detection and making sure problems do not happen again.

Requires:
 - pervasive monitoring
 - continuous testing at every step
 - 'stopping the production line' mentality

### 3. embrace experimentation and repetition
Foster a mentality of taking risks and learning from your mistakes, and know that repetition and practice is the road to mastery.

Requires:
 - culture of innovation and risk taking
 - high trust and empowerment
 - continual improvement of non-functionals
